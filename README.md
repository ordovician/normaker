This is a Maker website built with [nanoc][nanoc].

## Setup

Ruby 1.9 is required to build the site.

Get the nanoc gem, plus kramdown for markdown parsing:

    bundle install

You can see the available commands with nanoc:

    nanoc -h

Nanoc has [some nice documentation](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/docs/3-getting-started/) to get you started.  Though if you're mainly concerned with editing or adding content, you won't need to know much about nanoc.
