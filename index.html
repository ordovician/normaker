      <h1>Norwegian Maker</h1>

<p>This site caters to European or more specifically Norwegian Makers. A lot of the American sites have building instructions using inches and pounds, but most Europeans find that confusing. We would rather have our measurements specified in meters and kilograms. Living in a small European country, getting supplies can often be difficult. The problem is twofold:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Finding a supplier</li>
    <li>Figure out what the part is called in your native language</li> 
</ul>

<p>As Makers we are used to reading and writing in english because that is the language of the internet. However our hardware stores usually use names of items in our native language. But that is usually more trouble than help. For instance it took me quite a while to figure out that a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaft_collar">shaft collar</a> is called "aksel krage" in Norwegian.  </p>

<p>So that is what this site is all about help you figure out where to get parts and what it is called in your language. I will focus on Norwegian for now, but if I get feedback I'd love to add words from other European countries.</p>
